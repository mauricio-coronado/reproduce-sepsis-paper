Reproducing paper

To reproduce the results seen in the presentation reproduced_study_sepsis_algorithm.pdf you can follow the jupyter notebook reproduction_study_sepsis_algorithm_data_extraction.ipynb. It can also be run in Google Collab.

The jupyter notebook reproduction_study_sepsis_algorithm_data_extraction_v2.ipynb is a new version that has cleaner SQL code and also addresses some shortcomings of the original notebook like merging the queries from the different tables and an improved missing values imputation, unfortunately due to the large amount of data I couldn't run it without surpassing the RAM limit in Google Collab.
